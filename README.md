## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed
2. Install dependencies: ` pip install pyautogui keyboard `
4. Run the script

## Usage

- Use the buttons to add or remove click positions.
- Set the click interval by clicking "Set Interval".
- Save and load profiles to reuse click positions.
- Press `F8` anytime to start or stop the clicking process.

## Notes

- Run the program with administrator privileges if hotkeys don’t work.
- Make sure to allow the program to control your mouse for the clicking to work.
- If you build the .exe, the profiles will not work. I just wanted to try this, feel free to ignore it :)
